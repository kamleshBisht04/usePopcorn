I have used advanced React.js concepts to build this.\
It uses the useState and useEffect hooks and React forms and controlled components.\
The components are made from scratch, including the starRating component.

You can also rate your favorite movie and add the movie to your own personalised list.\
The data of the list will also be stored in your browser so it is a complete app.
